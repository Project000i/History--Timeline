                                        The first denomination with the image of Kurmanjan-datka was
                                        issued in 1994, the most common banknote was issued in 2016, and in 2024 a new
                                        denomination of 50 soms was shown, also with the image of Kurmanjan-datka.
                                        Having taken over the power and title of "Datka" from her husband Alymbek Datka,
                                        Kurmanjan Datka had to replace her husband by taking power into her own
                                        hands.For the sake of her people, she had to accept the execution of her
                                        youngest son Kamchybek in order to preserve the future of the Alai Kyrgyz.She
                                        became the first and only woman in the history of the Muslim world to be given
                                        such a high status.
